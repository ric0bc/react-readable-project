# Readable project

This is my final project for Udacity's Redux course. In the app, user can post content to predefined categories.  User is also able to write comments to posts and vote up- or down all the posts and comments. For each posts and comments there are "edit" and "delete" buttons.

On the root page and the category page, Users can sort the posts after date or vote score.



## Start the app

To get started:

* Install and start the API server
    - `cd api-server`
    - `npm install`
    - `node server`
* In another terminal window, start the app
    - `cd frontend`
    - `npm install`
    - `npm start`
